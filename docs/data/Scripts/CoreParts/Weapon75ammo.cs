                     * What are approaches? How do they interact with other config variables?  What problems do they solve? 
                     *
                     * At the most basic level an "approach" is a collection of variables that allow you, the mod author, to tell the projectile how to "approach"
                     * a desired "destination" (aka position) when certain conditions are met and what to then do once it has arrived.  I say "destination/position" and not "target" on
                     * purpose, while the desired destination may be the "target" it often is not.  Keep in mind that approaches merely "influence" the projectiles path to
                     * a desired position, they do not absolutely determine it.  Instead you are telling the projectile where you want it to go and through which
                     * trajectory it should travel to get there, but ultimately you are setting the desired flight path, you are not the pilot.
                     *
                     * Approaches are an extension of Smarts and these variables are applied ontop of, not in place of, all other config variables. This means anything
                     * you set in other parts of the config will still influence approaches and sometimes in unexpected ways (i.e. trackingDelay or not finding a target
                     * can delay when an approaches begins).  In a few cases approaches have variables that override/alter/extend how non-approach variables behave.
                     *
                     * Approaches will not alter the path of a projectile until its start condition is met (and optionally maintained).  Prior to "starting" the
                     * projectile will behave as it would have had there was no approach defined.  This is also the case once all approaches have completed. 
                     *
                     * Approaches require you to think about projectile navigation in an abstract manner.  This is a good time to restate that you are merely "influencing" the
                     * projectile, you are not controlling/piloting it.  The battlefield is dynamic, always changing, you are setting objectives and providing rules to follow
                     * if certain conditions are met, nothing more.  You must also remember that although you are setting variables like positionB, positionC, elevation, lead
                     * upDirection, forwardDirection etc... these variables merely "influence" the projectiles heading relative to its current position and velocity, they do not
                     * represent its actual source nor destination positions, directions nor elevation.
                     *
                     * Said another way, imagine your projectile half way between its launcher and the "target" and it is at this time that your approach "starts".  If you were
                     * to then draw this scene out visually, you would draw three spheres representing positions which we will call "projectile current position (aka positionA)", "positionB"
                     * and "positionC", where you only get to define the latter two.  You then define two directions, a forward direction and an up direction.  You can
                     * also optionally set a desired "elevation" relative to the up direction and a desired "lead" relative to the forward direction, applied to the positionB and/or
                     * positionC.  Now draw a 1 and 2 that represents the modified positionB and positionC positions (taking into account elevation, lead, and rotations).  Your
                     * projectiles heading will by default attempt to steer to modified C position (2), or alternatively to modified B (1) if you set TrajectoryRelativeToB to true.
